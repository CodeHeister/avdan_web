# Simple window creation
If you know `JS/CSS/HTML` even basics, you already __can create a window__.

![[Examples#Create content element]]

This is an example of a `<div>` with `Hello, world!` inside, but it's __still an independent element__. Now we will __attach it to a window__.

![[Examples#Add to the app bar]]

We created __a list with apps for the app bar__ with _content_, _icon sources_ and _titles_ for windows. But we still should __load and fill our app bar__.

![[Examples#Load app bar]]

We've loaded our app bar and after this step __all the work is done by library__. On demo page you will see __your app bar with apps__. After __clicking__ on the icon __a window with your content will spawn__.

![[Examples#Launch on startup]]

You can also launch your window on startup, but it's ==not recommended== due to some reasons.
